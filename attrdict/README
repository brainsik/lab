This is yet another dict subclass which enables attribute (i.e., dot notation)
access to items. It differs from other implementations as only valid Python
identifiers and names not matching builtin dict methods or attributes can be
used. This prevents creating items that are only available through index
notation and protects the dict from having expected methods accidentally
demolished.

The goal was to create a dict that could be used as a replacement for Python's
builtin with as little disruption as possible.

Use nosetests to run the tests.
